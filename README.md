# CS 370 Web and Mobile Development Course

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the CS 370 Web and Mobile Development course. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students and educators alike, offering insights into the core concepts of software development with a focus on web and mobile platforms. Throughout this course, we delve into the intricacies of how software operates, exploring various frameworks and technologies that are pivotal in today's development landscape.

## Course Overview

In CS 370, we explore the foundational elements of web and mobile development, emphasizing the importance of writing optimized code. Our journey begins with the basics of HTML and CSS, enabling students to craft visually appealing and responsive web pages. From there, we transition into more complex topics, including modern development frameworks and libraries such as Django, React JS, and React Native. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application, students will gain the skills necessary to develop robust and efficient web and mobile applications.

## Technologies Covered

- **HTML & CSS**: The building blocks of the web, enabling the creation of structured and styled web pages.
- **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **React JS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly suited for developing single-page applications.
- **React Native**: An extension of React JS, designed for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
